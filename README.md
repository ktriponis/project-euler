# Project Euler

This repository is simply my attempt at solving problems from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/).

# Solved Problems

* [Multiples of 3 and 5](problem1)

# Goals

* Write all the code using TDD
* Follow SOLID principle where and when applicable
* Prioritize readability/maintainability

# Disclaimer

If you are browsing this repository in order to get the answers to the problems, I highly advise against it and suggest
trying to come up with a solution on your own. As the only reward from completing the tasks is your own satisfaction and
mental stimulus, there is nothing to be gained from cheating yourself.
